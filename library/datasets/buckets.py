# Bucket resolutions as (W, H), grouped into two token-count families: 4032
# (= 63*64) and 4200 (= 60*70). Both are highly composite, so each factors into
# many near-square→elongated patch grids — and crucially every bucket *exactly*
# fills its token count, so there is zero intra-bucket padding by construction.
#
# This table is designed for native shapes (the default mode): it collapses to
# just TWO distinct token counts → two compiled block graphs (via
# compile_blocks' flatten), with no padding and therefore no flash pad leak.
# The rope per-axis cap is 256 patches (max_img/patch_spatial); the largest dim
# here is 2016px → 126.
#
# Free-fit (opt-in `freefit=true`, see freefit_bucket / is_freefit_token_counts
# below and docs/proposal/free_aspect_token_band_resize.md) is the alternative:
# it keeps native aspect ratio and lands the token count anywhere inside a tier's
# band instead of snapping here. It coexists with — does not replace — this table
# (which stays the default and stays frozen for DCW) and rides compile_dynamic_seq
# so the off-table counts stay one graph.
#
# Two families instead of one because a single token count's divisors near √N
# are sparse (4032 alone jumps aspect 1.29→1.75); interleaving 4032 and 4200
# densely covers aspect space at the cost of one extra graph. Landscape mirrors
# (swap W, H) are included explicitly. Token count = (W//16)*(H//16).
#
# NOTE: DCW_ASPECT_BUCKETS below now draws its top-5 from this table (every
# entry is a real training bucket), so `make dcw` recalibration produces rows
# for every aspect_id. Do not reorder the DCW table (shipped fusion-head
# checkpoints key off it).
