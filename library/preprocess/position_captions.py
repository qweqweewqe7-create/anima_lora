"""Position-aware caption rewrite (v2) — detect subjects, bind tags to sides.

Orchestration for ``make caption-position``: detect the ``girl`` instances in a
multi-subject image, order them, tag each mask-blanked crop, and rewrite the
caption in the dataset's hand-written convention::

    <flat tag bag>. On the left, akita neru, yellow eyes. On the right, ...

v2 *moves* an attributable tag out of the flat bag into its clause (each
attribute asserted exactly once) rather than the additive v1 (``rewrite=False``).
Reversible via :func:`library.captioning.position_clauses.flatten_caption`;
lands only on the derived caption (``post_image_dataset/resized/<rel>.txt``),
never the hand-written master under ``image_dataset/``.

Takes its two models as injected callables (``detect_fn``/``tag_fn``), staying
import-free of SAM3/the tagger; ``scripts/preprocess/position_captions.py``
owns argparse + model loading.

Per-rule evidence and the knob table live in
``docs/experimental/position_captions.md``.
