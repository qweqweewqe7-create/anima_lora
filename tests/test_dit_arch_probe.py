"""DiT depth/width is read off the checkpoint, not assumed.

``anima-base-v1.0`` and every official variant are 28 blocks wide 2048, but
community depth-expansions ship the same architecture at a different depth
(Anima-2.9B: 40 blocks, LLaMA-Pro-style interleaved block insertion). The model
class has always been parametric; the *loader* used to fall through to the 28
default, so a 40-block checkpoint failed with 12 blocks' worth of unexpected
keys. ``probe_dit_arch`` closes that by counting blocks in the safetensors
header.

The count must key off the top-level ``blocks.N.`` stack only — the LLM adapter
carries its own ``llm_adapter.blocks.0..5``, and letting those through would
inflate the depth and produce a model that no checkpoint fits.
