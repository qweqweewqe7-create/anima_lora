"""Per-band dynamic-seq compilation (--compile_seq_bands) invariants.

Phase 0 of _archive/proposals/perband_dynamic_seq.md: band clustering is
data-driven over the actual token-count set (not EDGE_TOKEN_BANDS), band
dispatch picks the containing band or nothing, and register-token widening
must never silently merge adjacent bands. All torch-free (buckets helpers).
